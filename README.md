# hello-world
GitHub tutorial repository

Well, this is an experiment in seeing if I can use GitHub for general version control. I'll predicate it on the assumption that **all** the work I do will use markdown; that will further my general *markdown agenda* and also allow for cleaner editing, etc.

Hmmm... Do I need to use hard word wraps?
